# Global Azure Austria 2020 - Master PowerShell with Azure Automation Accounts

Session and demos by [Toni Pohl](https://twitter.com/atwork), [atwork-it.com](https://www.atwork-it.com/)

IT-Admins can automate with tools as PowerShell. With Azure Automation Accounts we get one step further: In this session we will see typical management and governance tasks automated with PowerShell scripts in a secure and automated way. Configure your runbooks in Azure Automation Accounts and secure, execute, schedule, and monitor your scripts in a controlled environment. If you are already a Powershell master, you will love Azure Automation Accounts and walk away with the wish to migrate your scripts instantly!

## For developers

Alternatively, developers can use the Microsoft Graph for accomplishing similar tasks. Check the group properties with Graph Explorer [aka.ms/ge](https://aka.ms/ge), similar like here:

- https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/groups?$filter=startswith(displayname,'my')
- See the channels, etc. https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/teams/bdebef61-fc39-45fc-9e16-ca927ecb7601/channels/
- Graph API has more actions, e.g. see the channels, e.g. see the tabs... https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/teams/bdebef61-fc39-45fc-9e16-ca927ecb7601/channels/19:fac22556a2764f46b161940b3fc01600@thread.skype/tabs

Have a good Microsoft 365 management with these PowerShell scripts!
